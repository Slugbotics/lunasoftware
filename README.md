Repo for Lunabotics Software

Make sure to download PlatformIO extension on VSCode

Then to open the folder that holds the Arduino framework, open the Lunabotics folder from within the extension. If you tried to run the code and you get an error that says #Arduino.h can't be accesssed or can't be opened, its because you need to open lunasoftware/Lunabotics in the pick a folder platform.io extension.
